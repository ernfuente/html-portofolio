<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
   I’m Ernesto. I grew up in Cuba, where there was no internet at all and our family computer felt 
   like gold. I fell in love with tech playing GTA—and especially Need for Speed: Most Wanted. When I was
   seven, I even paid 5 Cuban pesos to watch someone install a game with a serial key and a key generator. 
   After that, I started installing and fixing things myself, and my interest in computers took off.

   When my family moved to the United States, I spent a year without a computer. My mom later 
   bought a $500 budget PC that could only run simple games like Minecraft, but it was enough to get me 
   learning. I read guides, saved money from my first job, and built my own computer. It took a few tries to get 
   it working, and that process taught me patience and troubleshooting.

   Today, I’m studying Computer Science at Florida International University and taking a Udemy bootcamp 
   to become a full-stack web developer. I like building small, useful web apps, keeping my code clean, 
   and learning by doing. If you’re into web development or PC building, I’d love to connect.
